I use group work for assessment in both my modules.
For the second year I'm using blackboard's group system to facilitate the
creation of the groups. It allows you to create names for the groups, and this
year I decided to try and do something different than "Group 1", "Group 2",
"Group 3".

I used names of Mathematicians that are perhaps as not well known as most.

Here's the list:

1. Hypatia (350–415 CE, Egypt) – First known female mathematician, contributed to geometry and algebra.
2. Brahmagupta (598–668 CE, India) – Early work on zero and negative numbers.
3. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780–850 CE, Persia) – Father of algebra; introduced algorithms.
4. Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340–1425, India) – Founder of the Kerala School; early work on calculus.
5. Omar Khayyam (1048–1131 CE, Persia) – Solutions to cubic equations and a poet.
6. Thābit ibn Qurra (826–901 CE, Iraq) – Contributed to number theory and geometry.
7. Liu Hui (c. 225–295 CE, China) – Contributions to geometry and approximation of π.
8. Al-Samawal al-Maghribi (c. 1130–1180 CE, Morocco) – Work on algebra and polynomials.
9. Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718–1799, Italy) – Wrote one of the first comprehensive calculus textbooks.

11. Benjamin Banneker (1731–1806, USA) – African-American mathematician, astronomer, and surveyor.
12. Sophie Germain (1776–1831, France) – Work on elasticity theory and Fermat's Last Theorem.
13. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855, Germany) – Wide contributions, including number theory and statistics.

When using blackboard, you can upload the list of names to create the groups
directly. Here is one version of the formatted names that works:
