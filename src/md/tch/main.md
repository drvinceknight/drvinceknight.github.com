I believe learning takes place in a social constructivist framework which
implies my role as an educator is to empower and motivate students to build
their own understanding of a subject. My main ideas behind this were formed from
reading [1].

Further to this, I believe it is important to be able to offer a rationale for
all my pedagogic practice. Using a particular approach because of a traditional
context is not a sufficient and valid reason. This does not preclude my use of
traditional methods. An excellent text regarding evidence based practice in
learning is [2]  (a book I would recommend to all students).

Based on a wide range of evidence (for example [3, 4]) I aim to create an active
learning framework in my courses. My favored definition of active learning is
from [4]:

> "Active learning is generally defined as any instructional method that engages
> students in the learning process. In short active learning requires students
> to do meaningful learning activities and think about what they are doing."

My classes are a flipped learning environment [5]
making use of web technologies for the transfer of content ensuring class
meetings can be used appropriately for:

- inquiry;
- peer based activities;
- reactive discussions.

Whilst these approaches are not traditional they constitute evidence based
practice [2, 3, 4, 6] and I hope that one day they will in fact be traditional.

If there is any doubt as to the effectiveness of active learning approaches, for
example [7] inciting curiosity and
engagement are still beneficial to the students' learning. Indeed in [8] the
greatest predictors of academic performance are identified not as general
intelligence [9], but personality factors such as conscientiousness and
openness. Thus my main role and indeed responsibility is to help
students gain an interest and enthusiasm for the subject. This is something I
continuously strive to get better at.

Furthermore, I am conscious that some students would feel excluded by
my approaches. Indeed: a lifetime of education in passive learning environments
is not something that will be immediately broken, thus:

- I share my rationale and philosophy with all my students;
- The content delivery I aim to use allows students who do not want to engage in
  an active learning framework (despite the evidence for this providing a better
  learning outcome) to "consume" the content passively.

I aim to continuously reflect on my practice, for example publishing peer
reviewed articles such as [10]. Importantly, as in all evidence based practice,
when the evidence indicates that I should change my practice: I will.
