I have been teaching for about 15 years. One common point of interest from my
students (sometimes more than what I am teaching) is where I am from? I usually
let students try and figure it out, which until two years ago was what I thought
was essentially impossible (bravo to Ilia!).

### Where am I from is an ill defined question

If it simply means: where was I born? The answer is quite simple.

I was born in [Jos, Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos).

But that's probably not the right answer to the question as I left Nigeria very
young and do not remember it at all.

### Earliest memory

I lived to the age of about 7 in [Mthatha, South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mthatha).
I have some fond childhood memories and often wonder what would happen if I'd stayed in South Africa.
Perhaps, I'd have a South African accent and be a big springbok fan? But I
don't.

### Going to the Caribbean

From South Africa I went to the Caribbean via a very short pit stop (9 months)
in [Greenville, North Carolina, USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville%2C_North_Carolina).

From there I moved to [Dominica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica) (not to
be confused with the Dominican Republic). I spent about 2 years living on
Dominica. I spent a year in a local school and a year being home schooled there.
I really enjoyed my time exploring the rain forest and the huge number of rivers
on the island. Mainly doing so with my dog Scouty.

After Dominica, I moved to the French island of [Gaudeloupe, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe).
I was put directly in to a local primary school. I remember looking at my
[CM1](https://www.frenchentree.com/living-in-france/education/french-school-grade-equivalents/) teacher as we
both were working out how we were going to communicate with each other.

I became fluent in French going through the French education system up until the
age of about 16. These formative years where quite important and I felt French
and still cheer for the French rugby team.

### Rugby School in St Claude

I spent my last two years of secondary education at a rugby School in [Saint
Claude, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Claude%2C_Jura). This was a
period of my life I look back very fondly on.

### Cardiff

After completing the French [Baccalauréat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalauréat) I moved to Cardiff
where I studied mathematics, met my wife, had my children and got my chair.

### So where am I from?

I don't really know. I have been a foreigner my entire life. I learnt that often
children with pasts like mine are call [Third Culture Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid) although as I have
learnt more about myself (especially as I became a parent) I have realised that
that does not really apply.

I do have a British passport (from one of my parents) so perhaps that's another
possible answer.
