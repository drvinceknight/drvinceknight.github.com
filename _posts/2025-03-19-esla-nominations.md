I have been noniminated for 3 [Enriching Student Life Awards](https://www.cardiffstudents.com/your-voice/academic-reps/eslas/).

This is always quite a humbling and rewarding moment as a student has taken the time to express appreciation for things I try my very best to be good at.

In the past I've thrown a thank you note on twitter in the hope that the student 
in question might see that I aprpeciate them. I don't do that anymore but thought that there is a small chance they'd read this.

So: thank you. It means a lot.
