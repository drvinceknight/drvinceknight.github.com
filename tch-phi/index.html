  <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

    <p>I believe learning takes place in a social constructivist framework which
implies my role as an educator is to empower and motivate students to build
their own understanding of a subject. My main ideas behind this were formed from
reading [1].</p>
<p>Further to this, I believe it is important to be able to offer a rationale for
all my pedagogic practice. Using a particular approach because of a traditional
context is not a sufficient and valid reason. This does not preclude my use of
traditional methods. An excellent text regarding evidence based practice in
learning is [2]  (a book I would recommend to all students).</p>
<p>Based on a wide range of evidence (for example [3, 4]) I aim to create an active
learning framework in my courses. My favored definition of active learning is
from [4]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Active learning is generally defined as any instructional method that engages
students in the learning process. In short active learning requires students
to do meaningful learning activities and think about what they are doing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My classes are a flipped learning environment [5]
making use of web technologies for the transfer of content ensuring class
meetings can be used appropriately for:</p>
<ul>
<li>inquiry;</li>
<li>peer based activities;</li>
<li>reactive discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst these approaches are not traditional they constitute evidence based
practice [2, 3, 4, 6] and I hope that one day they will in fact be traditional.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt as to the effectiveness of active learning approaches, for
example [7] inciting curiosity and
engagement are still beneficial to the students' learning. Indeed in [8] the
greatest predictors of academic performance are identified not as general
intelligence [9], but personality factors such as conscientiousness and
openness. Thus my main role and indeed responsibility is to help
students gain an interest and enthusiasm for the subject. This is something I
continuously strive to get better at.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am conscious that some students would feel excluded by
my approaches. Indeed: a lifetime of education in passive learning environments
is not something that will be immediately broken, thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>I share my rationale and philosophy with all my students;</li>
<li>The content delivery I aim to use allows students who do not want to engage in
  an active learning framework (despite the evidence for this providing a better
  learning outcome) to "consume" the content passively.</li>
</ul>
<p>I aim to continuously reflect on my practice, for example publishing peer
reviewed articles such as [10]. Importantly, as in all evidence based practice,
when the evidence indicates that I should change my practice: I will.</p>
