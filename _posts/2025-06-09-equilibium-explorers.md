A few Game Theorists and I ([Marc Harper](https://github.com/marcharper) and [Nikoleta Glynatsi](https://nikoleta-v3.github.io))
have put together a Discord Server for an online Game Theorist community.

This is early and we're not too sure what will the community will be like but
the current goal is to be open to all sorts of game theorists as you can read in
the [landing page](https://github.com/drvinceknight/equilibrium_explorers):

> We aim to bring together hobbyists, educators, students, researchers, and developers to learn, share, and collaborate across all areas of game theory.

Please do take a look and say hi even if you're only slightly interested in the
topic :) You can help us shape the space :)
