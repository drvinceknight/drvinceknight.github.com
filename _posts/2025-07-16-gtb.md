I have written my game theory notes as a text book which you can read [here](https://vknight.org/gtb/).

Every chapter includes:

- Theory/Definitions/Examples with as much emphasis as possible on genuine
  examples.
- Software implementations (in Python): using available libraries like
  [gambit](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io), [pref_voting](https://pref-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [axelrod](https://axelrod.readthedocs.io) or [nashpy](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io).
- A notable research section where I aim to give context to the chapter.

You can see the structure of the book in this flow diagram (taken from the
introduction chapter):
